x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0

Generate factors of the coefficient of the x^2:
[(-1, -1), (1, 1)]

Generate factors of the constant term:
[(-1, -1), (1, 1)]

Test all the permutations until we find the one that solve the problem:
    x^2 factors = (-1, -1), constant factors = (-1, -1), sol = x^2 - 2x + 1

Found the permutation that solves our problem:

Factorize:
(- x + 1)(- x + 1) = 0
which implies:  - x + 1 = 0    OR    - x + 1 = 0

Solve: - x + 1 = 0

Subtract 1 on both sides of the equal sign:
- x + 1 - 1 = 0 - 1

Simplify both sides:
- x = - 1

Devide both sides by -1:
x = 1

Solution:
x = 1
